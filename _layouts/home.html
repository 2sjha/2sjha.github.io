        <p>
            I am a software developer. Presently, I am pursuing my MS in Computer Science degree at
            <a href="https://www.utdallas.edu">The University of Texas at Dallas</a>. Before this, I worked as a
            software engineer for four years in India. I've worked mostly as a backend developer, but I also have
            experience with frontend. <br />
            My latest job was at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/walmartglobaltechindia/">Walmart Global
                Tech</a>, where I worked in the E-Commerce domain for Walmart Mexico.

                <p class="desc">I was a member of the Promotions team for Walmart Mexico. My primary role was to migrate
                    the promotions platform from legacy architecture to newer microservices. After migration, we reduced
                    the promotion set-up time by 96%, cart page load-time reduced from 2.5s to 1s, and saved $MXN 16M in
                    licensing fees. We also enhanced the platform by integrating the in-store and e-Commerce promotions
                    to create a unified customer experience and an internal promotion set-up pipeline.<br />
                    Later, I moved to the Payments team, where I worked on creating a auto-renewal payment service
                    for Walmart Mexico mermbership programs.

                <p class="desc">June 2018 to Dec 2020</p>
                <p class="desc">I was one of the first members of the IoT team. This was my first job after graduating,
                    so I learned a lot here. We developed a scalable backend from scratch for a network of more than
                    50,000 Energy monitoring and conserving IoT devices, OYO Switch, deployed in 10,000 hotels across
                    India. I also created an Android app that was used for the initial set-up of the device. We also
                    created a React based tech-support portal, where we could see the devices' status and analytical
                    data. This website supported the hotel staff in case a device went offline.<br />
                    As an experiment project, we created multiple IoT enabled smart hotel rooms, where all room
                    appliances could be controlled via Alexa voice commands. I integrated the Alexa toolkit and the
                    backend server using AWS Lambda.<br />
                    The next project was to design and develop the backend for a Bluetooth-based Offline Smart-lock
                    installed at 500 vacation homes. We used the HMAC algorithm to generate codes on the fly for guests,
                    and the passcodes would remain active only during their stay. I also worked on a React Native
                    cross-platform app to set up and maintain the lock.

                <p class="desc">I created a community funding platform, where users could create events, goals or wishes
                    and share them with their friends. Friends & family could contribute money to support the events.
                    The platform consisted of 3 applications,
                    <a href="https://www.github.com/2sjha/khwish-app" target="_blank">an Android app</a>,
