The quote above is a comment in one of my most recent reddit obsessions. I have read the ballad of Ella twice and I've been thinking about it for 3 days, pretty much since I finished reading it.
If you want to read it before I spoil it any further, please go read it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomegreentext/comments/17kyjgx/anon_had_a_girlfriend/) or [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/greentext/comments/davcj3/the_ballad_of_ella/) or [mobile friendly version here](https://imgur.com/gallery/jNOru). Its a long read, but totally worth it.

# Immediate Thoughts

This was such an engaging story that my first thought after reading this was that if I enjoyed this, why did I stop (never really picked up) reading books. After finishing it, I was filled with such sadness and grief for Anon. At the same time, I was envious of Anon because he got together with the love of his life, although for a brief period. I can only imagine the pain of what it feels like to find that missing piece in your life, your life is full and then suddenly it is snatched away. To have that kind of love and passion for your girlfriend and have it returned back, must be the best thing. I'm also envious of Anon because Ella was so hot as he described. Of course Anon will exaggerate Ella's beauty coz he was so in love with her.


Then as a greentext enjoyer I had to think that it is "fake", and it very well might be. Even if it is fake, I treated it like a exceptionally well-written piece of fiction, like . I'm 27 and this is a story about some 18-20 year old college kids and has a lot of teen romance flavour to it, I dont even understand how or why did I relate to anon so much. These people are so far
