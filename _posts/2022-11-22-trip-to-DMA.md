# DMA

Dallas Museum of Art, [DMA](https://dma.org), is the place to the visit in Dallas, if you appreciate art or history. I've been there once, on a trip organized by the ICP (Inter Cultural Programs) at UTD. I really enjoyed my visit there. The museum has sections based on pieces from different countries/regions, e.g, North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia and Africa. Please see some pictures I clicked.

# Travel

I depend heavily on public transport, and GOPass from UTD helps me travel anywhere in Dallas, wherever there is DART connectivity. For students around UTD, I would suggest taking the 883East or the 232 to get to Cityline/Bush station, about 20-25 mins ride from UTD university stop. Then we take a DART tram/train towards downtown(Westmoreland station). We get down at St.Paul station, about 35mins ride, and then after about 10 mins of walking, we reach DMA.

# Tentative Plan - Wed, Nov 23, 2022
- I have reserved 5 tickets
- We plan to reach Cityline/Bush station by 11am
- By 11:50am we reach DMA
- Spend 3-4 hours there
- right outside DMA, there's Klyde Warren Park, we can spend some time there
- head back by evening, using same DART route.

PS - Hope this information helps. I just wanted to write a blog, so I wrote this. For my friends who are coming along, all this could've been a text, lol.
